	 VERSION 1.1.0
	 
	 Description:
	 <source_troops> are all the native BasicTroop variants taken from spcultures.xml.
     
	 possible values are: 
     imperial_recruit
	 aserai_recruit
	 sturgian_recruit
	 vlandian_recruit
	 battanian_volunteer
	 khuzait_nomad
	 
	 As of 1.1.0 EliteBasicTroop variants can also be replaced. Here are the values from spcultures.xml
	 imperial_vigla_recruit
	 aserai_youth
	 sturgian_warrior_son
	 vlandian_squire
	 battanian_highborn_youth
	 khuzait_noble_son
	 
	 
	 <target_troop> contains the IDs of the recruits from the troop tree you want to inject into the game. 
	 The new troop tree can be of another mod or integrated into this mod but you have to make sure the
	 troop tree is valid and works. The example uses my own Chael Nad'ra troop trees. 
	 HINT: You do NOT need to replace every single tier of units, only the base recruit! That recruit has 
	 to be set to is_base_troop="true" in the troop's XML file so the code can find the root of the troop tree.
	 
	 Target Troop Properties:
	 * percent (0-100): Defines the percentage with which the <target_troop> will replace the <source_troop>
	     If the percentages don't add up to 100% the rest of the percentage will be the chance that the
	     <source_troop> recruits will remain
	 * playeronly (true/false): Means that when AI tries to recruit the new target_troop recruits those recruits 
	     will be changed back to the original <source_troop> recruits! This way you can make some super
	     special troops that only you will command!
	 * cultureonly (true/false) - (requires 1.0.8 or higher): Means that only lords with the same culture as the 
	     <source_troop> will be able to recruit the custom units. If playeronly is set to TRUE cultureonly will 
		 be ignored! 
		 Example: Only a Lord with the Empire culture (<> Kingdom) will be able to recruit custom empire troops. 
		          But that means when the Lord becomes a vassal of the Aserai he will still be able to recruit
				  custom Empire troops because his own culture is still the Empire.
	 * kingdomonly (true/false) - (requires 1.1.0 or higher): Similar to cultureonly but in this case the culture 
	     of the Lords Kingdom will be checked instead of the Lords culture. 
		 Example: An Aserai Lord who is a vassal of the Empire will be able to recruit custom empire troops.
	 
	   
	   The <debugInfo> values ONLY control the alert output, they do not have any kind of impact
	   on the troop replacement.
