	GENERAL INFORMATION
	***************************
	Version of ATC.modconfig.xml: v1.6.0
	Required ATC version:         v1.6.x


	
	CHANGELOG
	***************************
	1.6.0
	- New configuration element: <Clan>
	  It is now possible to configure clans in addition to the already existing configurations for MapFactions
	  and Cultures. The logic is as follows:
	  1. Check if the Clan of the currently recruiting party is configured
	  2. Check if the MapFaction of the currently recruiting party is configured
	  3. Check if the Culture of the currently recruiting Party is configured (by using MapFaction id="default"
	     <Culture id="MyCulture" - see also example below
		 
	  CAREFUL! The old method of configuring the player_clan as MapFaction will NOT work anymore. You now have
	  to configure the player_clan as <Clan id="player_clan"> correctly.
	  
	  
	1.5.0
	- New attributes for <eliteTroops>: spawnChance, atPower & spawnChanceCap. Configuration 
	  options to give the player more control over the amount of elite troops spawned per faction/culture.
	
	- New token for <MapFaction>: "default". This can be used to apply a configuration for AI Lords where the
	  MapFaction is not known or too minor to be configured (i.e. for minor factions). Can be used as a fall-
	  back for all independent minor factions or as an option when you don't need the granularity of the 
	  faction configuration.
	  
	- New option in the ATC.settings.xml to allow ATC to create "dynamic" PartyTemplates based on the ATC
	  configuration. When set to "true" ATC overwrites the default party templates, which are based on 
	  the culture, with a custom party template based on the hero's faction/culture combination. So if the
	  hero joined the Northern Empire but is Battanian himself ATC will look for troops from the
	  empire_n|battania, empire_n|default or - NEW - from the default|battania configuration.
	
	
	1.4.0
	- Faction based configuration
	  From ATC.modconfig.xml version 1.4.0 on ATC allows you to configure you troops based on the ingame 
	  faction a settlement belongs to. Previously it was the culture which resulted in all empires sharing
	  the same troops

	- Possible to configure Faction/Culture combinations
	  You can configure separate basic and elite troop trees for each faction/culture combination. What this
	  means is that if the Empire captured an Aserai settlement you can configure special troop trees that
	  only spawn in those Empire/Aserai settlements.



	XML STRUCTURE EXPLAINED
	***************************
	<ATCConfig>
	This is the main tag enclosing the whole configuration
	
	<MapFaction></MapFaction>
	Denotes a configuration section for a given faction. There must be only one <MapFaction></MapFaction>
	segment for each faction! 
	Attributes:
	id				- faction id taken from spkingdoms.xml (Sandbox/ModuleData)
	
	Special Tokens:
	player_faction 	- Used to configure the player faction if the player is leading his own kingdom
	player_clan 	- Used to configure the recruits for settlements owned by the player's clan. Not a faction 
					  per se but a nice feature to allow the player to command his own troops early on without 
					  using the "playeronly" flag (see below)
	
	
	<Culture></Culture>
	Denotes a subsection of <MapFaction> and is used to configure settlements that have a different culture
	than the owner faction. This enables you to define mixed culture troop trees for captured settlements.
	Attributes:
	id 				- culture id taken from spcultures.xml (SandboxCore/ModuleData)
	
	Special Tokens:
	default 		- used to configure the faction's default/fallback configuration.
	
	
	<basicTroops></basicTroops>
	Denotes a subsection of <Culture> and is used to configure a set of basic recruits. Has no own attributes.
	
	
	<eliteTroops></eliteTroops>
	Denotes a subsection of <Culture> and is used to configure a set of elite recruits. Has no own attributes.
	
	
	<volunteer />
	Configures the actual recruit for the given faction and culture, separated by <basicTroops> and <eliteTroops>.
	Attributes:
	id				- id of the recruit spnpccharacters.xml for standard recruits or troop mod files for custom 
	                  recruits. This is where you configure the actual troops to be spawned!
	percent			- chance to spawn the troop. The percentages should add up to 100% or two things may happen:
	                  a) if above 100% the percentages will be automatically redistributed
					  b) if below 100% the remaining percent will be spawning the culture's base recruit
					     (NOT the one's configured under <Culture id="default">!)
	playeronly      - Used to designate a troop to be recruitable only by the player. Use with replacewith!
	clanonly        - Used to designate a troop to be recruitable only by the player's clan. Use with replacewith!
	                  playeronly and clanonly must not be used together!
	replacewith     - The troop ID that should be given to AI Lords if they attempt to recruit a recruit marked as
	                  playeronly. Only usabele in conjunction with playeronly or clanonly! If not provided ATC will 
					  spawn the culture's base recruits instead (NOT the one's configured under <Culture id="default">!)
	AIonly			- sadly still has no function yet as I have trouble with the recruiting UI
