	GENERAL INFORMATION
	***************************
	Version of ATC.modconfig.xml: v1.4.0
	Required ATC version:         v1.4.x


	 
	VERSION 1.4.0
	***************************
	NEW: Faction based configuration
	From ATC.modconfig.xml version 1.4.0 on ATC allows you to configure you troops based on the ingame 
	faction a settlement belongs to. Previously it was the culture which resulted in all empires sharing
	the same troops

	NEW: Possible to configure Faction/Culture combinations
	You can configure separate basic and elite troop trees for each faction/culture combination. What this
	means is that if the Empire captured an Aserai settlement you can configure special troop trees that
	only spawn in those Empire/Aserai settlements.



	XML STRUCTURE EXPLAINED
	***************************
	<ATCConfig>
	This is the main tag enclosing the whole configuration
	
	<MapFaction></MapFaction>
	Denotes a configuration section for a given faction. There must be only one <MapFaction></MapFaction>
	segment for each faction! 
	Attributes:
	id				- faction id taken from spkingdoms.xml (Sandbox/ModuleData)
	
	Special Tokens:
	player_faction 	- Used to configure the player faction if the player is leading his own kingdom
	player_clan 	- Used to configure the recruits for settlements owned by the player's clan. Not a faction 
					  per se but a nice feature to allow the player to command his own troops early on without 
					  using the "playeronly" flag (see below)
	
	
	<Culture></Culture>
	Denotes a subsection of <MapFaction> and is used to configure settlements that have a different culture
	than the owner faction. This enables you to define mixed culture troop trees for captured settlements.
	Attributes:
	id 				- culture id taken from spcultures.xml (SandboxCore/ModuleData)
	
	Special Tokens:
	default 		- used to configure the faction's default/fallback configuration.
	
	
	<basicTroops></basicTroops>
	Denotes a subsection of <Culture> and is used to configure a set of basic recruits. Has no own attributes.
	
	
	<eliteTroops></eliteTroops>
	Denotes a subsection of <Culture> and is used to configure a set of elite recruits. Has no own attributes.
	
	
	<volunteer />
	Configures the actual recruit for the given faction and culture, separated by <basicTroops> and <eliteTroops>.
	Attributes:
	id				- id of the recruit spnpccharacters.xml for standard recruits or troop mod files for custom 
	                  recruits. This is where you configure the actual troops to be spawned!
	percent			- chance to spawn the troop. The percentages should add up to 100% or two things may happen:
	                  a) if above 100% the percentages will be automatically redistributed
					  b) if below 100% the remaining percent will be spawning the culture's base recruit
					     (NOT the one's configured under <Culture id="default">!)
	playeronly      - Used to designate a troop to be recruitable only by the player. See also replacewith!
	replacewith     - The troop ID that should be given to AI Lords if they attempt to recruit a recruit marked as
	                  playeronly. Only usabele in conjunction with playeronly! If not provided ATC will spawn the
					  culture's base recruits instead (NOT the one's configured under <Culture id="default">!)
	AIonly			- sadly still has no function yet as I have trouble with the recruiting UI
