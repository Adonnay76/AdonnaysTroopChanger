<!-- ATC settings for ATC 1.5.x

	Since MCM and Modlib are still known for their compatibility problems
	(which I'm sure they'll fix eventually) I decided to remove MCM for now.
	
	The following configuration is identical to what the MCM version 
	provided, it is just not usable from in game anymore.
	
	EnableModScan 		  - This option enables or disables the mod's functionality
							to scan for ATC configuration files in the subfolders
							of active mods (and active mods only)
					
	EnableCustomTemplates - Allows ATC to replace the default party templates (found
	                        in PartyTemplates.xml) with dynamically generated templates
							created from your current ATC config.
	
	DebugConfigRead       - This setting lets you control the amount of debug
							messages in the ATC.debug.log in regards to the 
							configuration.
					  
	DebugRecruitSpawn 	  - This setting lets you control the amount of debug
							messages in the ATC.debug.log in regards to the 
							actual spawning of new recruits.
					  
	DebugAIRecruiting 	  - This setting lets you control the amount of debug
							messages in the ATC.debug.log in regards to the 
							actual troops AI lords are recruiting.
					  						
	RecruitSpawnFactor 	  - Can slow down or fasten up the spawning rate of new recruits
						    Default value is 1.0, can be set to anything between 0.0 and 2.0
						    Anything above 2.0 is unreasonable and untested.
							
	EliteSpawnChance	  - Determines how many % of spawned troops are elite troops. This 
	                        Spawn Chance is achieved roughly at the given ElitePowerThreshold 
							and	is lower below that threshold and can be higher above. the 
							EliteSpawnChanceCap should always be set to prevent spawn chances
							being to high.
							This is the default value when no specific values are added
							to the <eliteTroops> tag in the modconfig.xml files.
	
	EliteSpawnChanceCap	  - Maximum Spawn Chance of elite troops.
							This is the default value when no specific values are added
							to the <eliteTroops> tag in the modconfig.xml files.
	
	ElitePowerThreshold	  - Notable power required to spawn elite troops. At this threshold 
	                        the configured EliteSpawnChance is reached. Notables with less
							power can still receive elite troops but at a lower chance.
							This is the default value when no spe values are added
							to the <eliteTroops> tag in the modconfig.xml files.
	
	RecruitMaxUpgradeTier - Recruits in settlements have a daily possibility of getting
	                        upgraded to the next tier. This value servers as an upper
							limit on how far recruits can level up. The vanilla value is
							Tier 4.
							
	LevelRecruitsUpToTier - Similar to the VolunteersUpTier addon from the Realistic Battle
	                        Mod. Since ATC and the VolunteersUpTier addon are not compatible
							I offer a similar function within ATC directly. Leave at 1 for
							no automatic up tier. 
							Difference to the setting RecruitMaxUpgradeTier: 
							This will ALWAYS level the recruit up to the selected level!

	MaxLogSizeinKB		  - As the name suggests the maximum log size in KiloBytes. A measure
	                        to prevent huge log files in longer play sessions.
