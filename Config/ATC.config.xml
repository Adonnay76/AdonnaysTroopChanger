<!-- DISCALIMER!
	 WHATEVER YOU DO HERE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. I TAKE NO - NONE WHATSOEVER - RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 
	 SAFETY OF YOUR SAVEGAME. YOUR SAVEGAME MAY BLOW UP... DISINTEGRATE... VANISH... AND TAKE YOUR 
	 WHOLE COMPUTER WITH IT. 
	
	 YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

	 source_troops are all the native base_troop variants taken from spcultures.xml.
     
	 possible values are: 
     imperial_recruit
	 aserai_recruit
	 sturgian_recruit
	 vlandian_recruit
	 battanian_volunteer
	 khuzait_nomad
	 
	 Target_troop contains the IDs of the recruits from the troop tree you want to inject into the game. 
	 The new troop tree can be of another mod or integrated into this mod but you have to make sure the
	 troop tree is valid and works. The example uses my own female warrior troop tree.
	 
	 Target Troop Properties:
	 * percent: Defines the percentage with which the <target_troop> will replace the <source_troop>
	     If the percentages don't add up to 100% the rest of the percentage will be the chance that the
	     <source_troop> recruits will remain
	 * playeronly: Means that when AI tries to recruit the new target_troop recruits those recruits 
	     will be changed back to the original <source_troop> recruits! This way you can make some super
	     special troops that only you will command!
	 * cultureonly (NEW with 1.0.8): Means that only lords with the same culture as the <source_troop> will
	     be able to recruit the custom units. If playeronly is set to TRUE cultureonly will be ignored!
		 Example: Only a Lord with the Empire culture (<> Kingdom) will be able to recruit custom empire troops. 
		          But that means when the Lord becomes a vassal of the Aserai he will still be able to recruit
				  custom Empire troops because his own culture is still the Empire.
	 * kingdomonly: Similar to cultureonly but in this case the culture of the Lords Kingdom will be checked
	     instead of the Lords culture. 
		 Example: An Aserai Lord who is a vassal of the Empire will be able to recruit custom empire troops.
	 
	   
	   The <debugInfo> values ONLY control the alert output, they do not have any kind of impact
	   on the troop replacement.
	   
	   FOR THIS SAMPLE XML TO WORK YOU HAVE TO RENAME THIS FILE TO "ATC.config.xml"!
