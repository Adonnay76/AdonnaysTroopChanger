<!-- DISCALIMER!
	 WHATEVER YOU DO HERE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. I TAKE NO - NONE WHATSOEVER - RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 
	 SAFETY OF YOUR SAVEGAME. YOUR SAVEGAME MAY BLOW UP... DISINTEGRATE... VANISH... AND TAKE YOUR 
	 WHOLE COMPUTER WITH IT. 
	
	 YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

	 source_troops are all the native base_troop variants taken from spcultures.xml.
     
	 possible values are: 
     imperial_recruit
	 aserai_recruit
	 sturgian_recruit
	 vlandian_recruit
	 battanian_volunteer
	 khuzait_nomad
	 
	 Target_troop contains the IDs of the recruits from the troop tree you want to inject into the game. 
	 The new troop tree can be of another mod or integrated into this mod but you have to make sure the
	 troop tree is valid and works. The example uses my own female warrior troop tree.
	 
	 * The attributes percent="xy" and playeronly HAVE to be provided or the game will crash. 
	 * If the percentages don't add up to 100% the rest of the percentage will be the chance that the
	   source_troop recruits will remain
	 * playeronly means that when AI tries to recruit the new target_troop recruits those recruits 
	   will be changed back to the original source_troop recruits! This way you can make some super
	   special troops that only you will command!
	 * cultureonly (NEW with 1.0.8) means that only lords with the same culture as the <source_troop> will
	   be able to recruit the custom units. If playeronly is set to TRUE cultureonly will be ignored!
	 * The random number generator is a bit wonky so some villages may have tons of new troops while others
	   have none, unless of course you set the percentage to 100% for one target_troop recruit
	   
	   The <debugInfo> values ONLY control the alert output, they do not have any kind of impact
	   on the troop replacement.
	   
	   FOR THIS SAMPLE XML TO WORK YOU HAVE TO RENAME THIS FILE TO "ATC.config.xml"!
